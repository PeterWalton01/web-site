        <h2>My Background</h2>
        <p class="main-text">Welcome to my portfolio website.</p>
        <br />
        <p class="main-text">
          I am a highly motivated, experienced technical manager with a long
          history of successful projects, delivering excellent customer
          solutions. Many of these were integration projects and involved high
          levels of innovation to deliver new services. A good number of these
          projects were strategically significant and supported large renewable
          revenue streams amounting to millions of pounds per year. My key
          management skills include team leadership, motivation, and direction.
          During the development of new solutions, I believe that a keen
          understanding of customer requirements and the ability to envisage
          processes and solutions to meet these are essential. My technical
          skills include a strong understanding of technologies and how they
          lead to excellent solutions requiring low levels of administration and
          maintenance. My main objective when working on projects is to support
          a shock-free project environment. This allows the sponsors to track
          progress with a light touch, leaving them free to focus on other
          activities.

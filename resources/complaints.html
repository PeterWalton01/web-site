          This page contains information about a machine learning project concerning complains 
          made to The New York Housing Department. This was completed as the final module in IBM Professional Certificate in Python Data Science and Machine Learning. The project was supplied with two data feeds - this first was a set of complaints raised with the housing department, the second feed was a set of characteristics of the building concerned. </p>

            <p class="short-desc">
              The department wishes to answer the following questions:
                <ol class="project-or-list">
                  <li>Which type of complaint should the Department of Housing Preservation and Development of New York City focus on first?</li>
                  <li>Should the Department of Housing Preservation and Development of New York City focus on any particular set of boroughs, ZIP codes, or street (where the complaints are severe) for the specific type of complaints you identified in response to Question 1?</li>
                  <li>Does the Complaint Type that you identified in response to question 1 have an obvious relationship with any particular characteristic or characteristics of the houses or buildings?</li>
                  <li>Can a predictive model be built for a future prediction of the possibility of complaints of the type that you have identified in response to question 1?</li>
                </ol>
                <br>

                The following four links lead to the analysis and conclusion for each question: <br><br>
